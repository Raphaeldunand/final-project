Project Proposal
MIS3640
CO2e Emissions Project:
The Project objective will be to demonstrate the use of Python through the creation of a program that will allow the user to track the carbon footprint they create -- specifically CO2e emissions. The program will allow users to input information such as x,y,z. This program will get information from APIs that are available to provide this information to the user. They will be able to get this data for different locations that have the available information, further allowing the user to understand the changes in their footprint in other areas.

The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal? The project objective will be to demonstrate the use of Python through the creation of a program that will allow the user to track the carbon footprint they create -- specifically CO2e emissions.  We will strive to collect data from APIs on carbon emissions that are connected with food, travel, and waste.  We hope to minimally achieve the summation of carbon emissions based on inputs given by the user. The stretch goal would be to calculate carbon emissions based on location and additional inputs. More options for the inputs can be added such as which mode of transport was used. More inputs can also be added to stretch the goal even more.

Learning Goals: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.
As a team, we hope to better understand the use of functions and use of python by working together in one document to achieve the main purpose of the project which is to calculate CO2e emissions. Individually, we are working to gain experience with working together and exposing ourselves to different thoughts to achieve a better understanding of python. We hope to understand more about how API can be integrated in python and creating a nice user interface. It would also be interesting to learn more about new libraries. 

Implementation Plan: this will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.
In order to implement this project, we hope to follow this action plan:

    First, create a function to calculate the CO2e emission for each variable that we decide to implement into the project two

    Secondly, create a function that will be based on the location of choice of the user. It will convert the variables that we will be finding to the locations and calculate the changes that might be present

    Finally, we will create a function that will read the API information that will either read from the site or read from a data folder in the program to extract specific information as desired.

This will be achieved by the continue learning from class lectures and also through independent research that will be constructed in sections.
Project schedule: You have 8 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.


	In the remaining time that we have for the project, we will be trying to adhere to a schedule that will allow us per week to create one section of the python code and make sure to refine the code to make sure that is simple and easy to understand.  Before this, we will take about 1-2 weeks to complete the data collection for the specific data that we will be using throughout our program. We will save the last two weeks in further simplifying the code and creating readable code for the user. Also, if we decide to structure the program within a website, we will do so as well throughout the structuring of data. Should we add this? The benefit of our project is that we will have a working interface pretty early. We will then be adding to this to make it more accurate (and complicated) by adding more inputs. 
Collaboration plan: How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.
Our plan of collaboration will be to tackle each code separately but come together and discuss what would be the best code to incorporate. This will be achieved through set time meetings within the week and working collaboratively within our 30 min - 1 hr meetings. This will allow us to learn from each other and also allow us to collaborate more effectively to learn new methods in executing code. 

Due to this plan of collaboration a flat structure will be most beneficial for our team. Everyone will have equal responsibility in this project. This equal responsibility will help boost communication within the group which will be extremely important due to the schedules that everyone has.

Risks: What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?
The biggest risks to the success of this project will be the time commitment that each one of us can achieve throughout this project. Along this line, the ability for us to submit our deliverables will be crucial for us to continue working on the project and set out the best code and program that we can. Another risk is that we are not able to implement the more complicated inputs to our project. This would leave it somewhat simple and not very interesting. 
Additional Course Content: What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?
For this project, The following classes will surely help with the completion of our project will be 
Debugging
Flask Project HTML
API for calculating distances
This will allow the team to create a polished version of the project that is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly.
